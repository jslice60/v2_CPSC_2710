# Project Title: Airport Services App

## Vision
The landing page is broken down into 4 parts for a user to research information about a specific airport.

- Feature 1: Airports 
- Feature 2: Lounges
- Feature 3: Flight Schedule
- Feature 4: Aircraft

## Working Parts
- Feature 1: Fully operational
  - This includes a loading function GUI, where an animation will spin while the next window populates.
- Feature 2: Not Operational
- Feature 3: Not Operational
- Feature 4: Not Operational

## How to Run each Feature
- Feature 1: Click on the text "Airports" to enter the airports research window. Select an airport by entering the correct code (ie KLAX). Press enter to search or click the search button. This will also return a map of local area. To enter another search, simply delete the text you enter and type another code. You can also use the clear button to clear all fields. Press escape to return to the homepage.
